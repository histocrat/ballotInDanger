# Ballot In Danger
See it live at ballotindanger.com

If you voted through the mail in the 2020 election, Republicans are filing lawsuits to have your ballot thrown out.

Your ballot is in the most danger if it hasn't been accepted by your state's voting office yet. 

If it hasn't, depending on which state you're in, you need to find a safe way to vote in person on November 3rd or contact your board of elections to fix your ballot.
